# Cardano GraphQl Client POC
This is a small POC for using the to use [purescript-graphql-client](https://github.com/OxfordAbstracts/purescript-graphql-client) to connect to [input-output-hk/cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql).

### Quick Start
First you need to follow the instructions in [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql#b-pull-and-run-via-docker-compose) to have a local version of the cardano-graphql. Keep in mind that you probably need to increase the memory docker has available in order for ogmios to run without crashing.

Then you need to download and execute this repository with the following instructions.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hrajchert/cardano-graphql-client-poc.git
cd cardano-graphql-client-poc
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

### Notes
The code inside the `Cardano` folder was autogenerated using the `generate-graphql.js` script. Two slight modifications were needed in order for it to work properly:

* Inside `Cardano/Symbols.purs` a Proxy named `type` was created, which is a protected keyword, so I commented that.
* Inside `Cardano/Schema/GraphQL.purs` the type `DateTime` is duplicated. I need to investigate the reason behind this further.

I tried to use subscriptions but it seems that for the moment `cardano-graphql` is not providing that mechanism.
